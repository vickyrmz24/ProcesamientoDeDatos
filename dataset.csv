m/spider_man_homecoming,Nick De Semlyen,FALSE,Empire Magazine,Fresh,5-Apr,6/29/2017,"The characters and scenarios are familiar, but this is a loose, cool, funny remix that makes them feel fresh again. Plus, it's mercifully short on life lessons from Aunt May."
m/spider_man_homecoming,Stefan Pape,FALSE,HeyUGuys,Fresh,5-Apr,6/29/2017,"Spidey is finally able to bounce off other familiar faces, and the results are nothing short of a triumph."
m/spider_man_homecoming,Jonathan L. Fischer,TRUE,Slate,Fresh,,6/29/2017,Spider-Man: Homecoming is both a homecoming for the character as well as a movie in which Spider-Man literally goes to homecoming-a fitting re-introduction and an endearingly goofy teen flick.
m/spider_man_homecoming,Alan Scherstuhl,TRUE,Village Voice,Fresh,,6/29/2017,The first Spidey flick as ebullient as the comics you read when you were a kid.
m/spider_man_homecoming,Julian Roman,FALSE,MovieWeb,Fresh,5-Apr,6/29/2017,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is a funny, heartfelt, coming of age story that defly captures the awkwardness of being a teenager."
m/spider_man_homecoming,Jordan Hoffman,FALSE,Popular Mechanics,Fresh,,6/29/2017,"Peter Parker aka Spider-Man aka the wise-crackin', science-tinkerin', shy-around-girls neighborhood crime-fighter is back. Not just back-home."

m/spider_man_homecoming,Bill Goodykoontz,TRUE,Arizona Republic,Fresh,5-Apr,6/29/2017,"What's particularly nice about this movie is what it doesn't have: too many bad guys, an overly complicated plot and a bunch of ridiculous fight scenes that are so needlessly complex you can't tell what's happening in them."

m/spider_man_homecoming,Tasha Robinson,FALSE,The Verge,Fresh,,6/29/2017,"Every time Peter has to choose whether to do his self-appointed job or seize one irreplaceable personal moment with Liz, the strain shows on his face. Civil War made his conflicts big, funny, and thrilling. Homecoming makes them personal."
m/spider_man_homecoming,Scott Menzel,FALSE,We Live Entertainment,Rotten,10-Apr,6/29/2017,Spider-Man: Homecoming is better than Spider-Man 3 but not by much.
m/spider_man_homecoming,Joe Gross,FALSE,Austin American-Statesman,Fresh,,6/29/2017,"Holland is incredibly charming, and embodies Spidey's traditional fondness for wisecracks while not seeming smug. The jokes fly fast, but everything hangs together tonally."
m/spider_man_homecoming,Bernard Boo,FALSE,PopMatters,Fresh,10-Aug,6/29/2017,"It's pure exhilaration to watch this new, pitch-perfect version of the iconic hero swing high above the New York City streets, and if the movie's forthcoming sequels are as fun as this, Marvel Studios can keep 'em coming."

m/spider_man_homecoming,Peter Travers,TRUE,Rolling Stone,Fresh,4-Mar,6/29/2017,News Flash: Tom Holland is the best movie Spider-Man ever. He finds the kid inside the famous red onesie and brings out the kid in even the most hardened filmgoer.

m/spider_man_homecoming,Matt Goldberg,FALSE,Collider,Fresh,5-Apr,6/29/2017,"Homecoming takes Peter Parker in a fresh direction not only by investing in his teenage world rather than using it as a backdrop, but by letting him run towards being Spider-Man rather than wrestle with the weight of his responsibilities."
m/spider_man_homecoming,Lindsey Bahr,TRUE,Associated Press,Fresh,4-Mar,6/29/2017,"You know what? Superhero cynicism aside, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is really fun."
m/spider_man_homecoming,Jordan Raup,FALSE,The Film Stage,Fresh,B-,6/29/2017,"On paper, it's among the most inessential blockbusters of the year, but Spider-Man: Homecoming proves that going back to square one and adding good-hearted altruism can go a long way."

m/spider_man_homecoming,Harry Guerin,FALSE,RTÉ (Ireland),Fresh,5-Apr,6/30/2017,"The less you know about the plot the more the fun, suffice to say that Homecoming trades adolescent angst for hit-the-spot humour (top work from co-stars Jacob Batalon and Zendaya) and throws in some surprises 'twixt webs and wisecracks."

m/spider_man_homecoming,Alex Abad-Santos,FALSE,Vox,Fresh,4.5/5,6/30/2017,"The movie is a soaring, fearless teenage dream. And it feels so great to be able to say: Welcome home, Spidey."

m/spider_man_homecoming,Brian Viner,FALSE,Daily Mail (UK),Fresh,5-Apr,7/1/2017,I can't think of a movie from the prolific Marvel Cinematic Universe that I have enjoyed more.
m/spider_man_homecoming,A.A. Dowd,TRUE,AV Club,Fresh,B,7/1/2017,"For a film with six screenwriters, Homecoming creates a remarkably coherent vision of a smart kid still dumb about the world, battling the learning curves of his double lives."

m/spider_man_homecoming,Gary Thompson,FALSE,Philadelphia Daily News,Fresh,4-Mar,7/5/2017,"The movie is as bubbly and eager as Peter himself, but a little more efficient.

m/spider_man_homecoming,Mick LaSalle,TRUE,San Francisco Chronicle,Rotten,4-Feb,7/5/2017,"The movie breaks no new ground, and action sequences that were intended to be thrilling - such as an epic battle on the Staten Island Ferry - just sit there on the screen, incapable of stirring a single pulse, but content in their competence."
m/spider_man_homecoming,Jason Zingale,FALSE,Bullz-Eye.com,Fresh,3.5/5,7/5/2017,"The movie delivers all of the expected action beats, but what it does better than perhaps any of the previous Spider-Man films is capture the humor and sense of fun from the comics."
